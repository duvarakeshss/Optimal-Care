Overview
The Hospital Data Management System is a C++ application designed to efficiently manage patient data within a hospital environment. The system utilizes Red-Black Trees data structure to organize and manage patient records effectively.

Features
Patient Management: Allows adding, removing, and updating patient records.
Search Functionality: Provides efficient searching of patient records based on various parameters such as name, ID, condition, etc.
Medical Records: Maintains medical history and records for each patient securely.

Requirements
C++ compiler (C++11 or later)
Standard Template Library (STL) support
Red-Black Trees implementation (included in the project)

Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/hospital-management.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd hospital-management
Compile the source code: g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o hospital_management
Run the executable: ./hospital_management

Usage
Upon running the executable, the user will be presented with a menu providing various options for managing patient data.
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform desired operations such as adding a patient, searching for a patient, scheduling appointments, etc.
Implementation Details
Red-Black Trees: The core data structure used for efficient management and retrieval of patient records.
Object-Oriented Design: The project follows an object-oriented approach to encapsulate data and functionality into classes for better organization and reusability.
File Handling: Patient records may be persisted to disk for long-term storage and retrieval.
